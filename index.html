<h1>The HTML help website</h1>
<h3>By Gavin Carpenter and Maxim Chintalov</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>This is the best coding help website</h2>
<h2>Step 1:setting up your website</h2>
<br>
<p>You might want to know that * means < and ** means ></p>
<br>
<h3>first you want to open my documents</h3>
<h3>and make a folder called HTML </h3>
<h3>then go into notepad</h3>
<h3>And then type these words in it</h3>
<p> *!DOCTYPE html** </p>
<p> *html lang="en"** </p>
<p> *head** </p>
<p> *meta charset="utf-8** </p>
<p> *title**MY FIRST WEBSITE*title** </p>
<p> */head** </p>
<p> *body** </p>
<p> */body** </p>
<p> */html**
<h3>When there is a backslash (/) it means that is the end of that type of code </h3>
<h3> so */html** means thal it is the end of the html code </h3>
<h3> in between *body** and */body** you should write </h3>
<p> *p** "this is my first website" */p** </p>
<h3> p stands for paragraph, and it will be your main function  of writing on your website </h3>
<h3> there are 7 sizes of writing in html </h3>
<h1>They are *h1** </h1>
<h2>*h2**</h2>
<h3>*h3**</h3>
<h4>*h4**</h4>
<h5>*h5**</h5>
<h6>*h6**</h6>
<p>and *p**</p>
<h3>the higher the number next to the h, the smaller it is</h3>
<h3>p is somewhere between h4 and h5</h3>
<h3>I am writing this in h3</h3>
<h3> now you want to do control+s on your computer keyboard </h3>
<h3> and call it MYWEBHTML.html </h3>
<h3> at the bottom, change the encription to UTF-8 </h3>
<h3> and save it to the folder named HTML </h3>
<h3> then close out all windows </h3>
<h3> and go into the folder </h3>
<h3> click on the program </h3>
<h3> and you should see "this is my first website" come up </h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 2: putting images on your website </h2>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>to put images in, you have to use *img** </h3>
<h3>the code is *img src=" " /** </h3>
<h3>in between the quotes you would put the location of the picture </h3>
<h3> for example, *img src="http://images.bestbuy.com/BestBuyUS/js/survey/bbylogo.png" /** </h3>
<h3> would show the Best Buy Logo. </h3>
<h3> you must use /** at the end of the img code instead of */img** </h3>
<h3>you can use the width and height commands, such as, </h3>
<h3>so yeah... on to step 3!</h3>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Step 3: CSS programing for coloring text and the backround
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Now we are going to use a new programing language called CSS or Cascading Style Sheets</h3>
<h3>We are going to use this to color text</h3>
<h3 id="CSS-color-example">like this</h3>
<h3>so first, in between the p and the bracket write id=test</h3>
<h3> like this: *p id="test"**</h3>
<h3>and then you must go in between the *head** and */head** tags and write this...</h3>
<h3>*style type="text/css"**
<br>
#test {
<br>
	color:red;
<br>
}
<br>
*/style**
<h3>you must copy it exactly like that</h3>
<h3>when you do that...</h3>
<h3 id="test">this happens</h3>
</body>
</html>
